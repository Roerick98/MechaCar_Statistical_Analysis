## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Within the analysis, I used multiple linear regression to compute both the R squared and p values. Passing in the vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD variables, I was able to perform linear regression to compute a model that would predict mpg values based on instances of these variable inputs.<br /> ![Screenshot 2021-10-11 000518](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35403433/136731777-975c4acd-b836-4aaf-958c-b552ac0827ae.png) <br />
As you can see, the approximated R-squared value was 0.7149. Therefore, this is a strong model that describes this dataset. Also, the p-value is extremely small, 5.35 x 10^-11, which is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero. 
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
As you can see, both Lot 1 and Lot 2 meet all of the desired design specifications and contain nearly the exact same mean and median. Lot 3, however, contains the largest standard deviation by far and exceeds the design specifications for variance. <br /> ![Screenshot 2021-10-11 004319](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35403433/136734862-7b95f7ae-e712-402a-ad14-6bf2570f96e8.png) <br />
## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
T-tests of both lot 1 and lot 2 concluded that they contain the same mean PSI (1,500 pounds per square inch) as the poulation mean. This was indicated by their computed p-values, namely 1 and 0.6072 respectively. Lot 3, however, computed a p-value of 0.04168, which is less than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, and conclude that the mean PSI for lot 3 is statistically different then the population mean.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
One area of testing that we could possibly explore would be engine type and fuel efficiency. Of course it is clear that different engine types offer different speeds, however the ratio of speeds that different engines produce could be of interest to MechaCar manufacturers. Fuel efficiency has also been of interest to car manufacturers, since efficient engines are a huge selling point to the public. Therefore, in order to decide whether or not engine type and fuel efficiency adds to the performance of vehicles, we must construct and test a hypothesis. This null hypothesis could be Engine type and fuel efficiency increase a car's performance". The alternative, therefore,would be the opposite, "Engine type and fuel efficiancy decrease a car's performance". In order to test this hypothesis, we could perform both a two-sample t-Test. The two-sample t-Test could be used to test whether a car that contains an enhanced engine with a high-grade fuel source and a car with a lesser engine and fuel source have statistically different mean performances. We would need samples that are random. numerical and continuous, a large size, and if possible, the variance of the data should be similar to the population.
